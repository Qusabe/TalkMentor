# TalkMentor

Just a university project as a first try of bunch of students in desktop app developing. 

App was designed to help people to improve their diction with different exercises such as tongue-twisters. 
User can keep track of their progress with recording their tries and compare new recordings to the old ones. 
Also there are a user account page for its purpose.

App could be improved with AI-analyser of user tries, function of auto-updates, scalability of main menu for more exercises and scalability of app window 
for different screen resolutions
